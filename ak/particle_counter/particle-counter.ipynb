    "Patrick is an optical particle counter for stationary use, operating on the principle of light obscuration. By continuously monitoring purity, variances in a machine can be detected quickly and appropriate measures can be taken. Data transmission via CAN, USB (adapter) or RS232. Display of cleanliness level in accordance with ISO 4406:99 / SAE AS 4059 / NAS 1638 / GOST 17216.\n",

    "The optical particle counter for mobile applications. Thanks to the integrated gear pump, samples from oil tanks or sample bottles can be analyzed on site for their degree of contamination, eliminating the need to physically send in oil samples. As a result, maintenance work can be tailored to individual requirements, depending on the degree of cleanliness. Use Patrick in the Box for mineral oils (e.g. HLP), ester liquids (e.g. HEES), bio-oils (e.g. HETG) or diesel fuels.\n",
